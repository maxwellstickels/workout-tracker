## Overview

Workout Tracker is an application which allows users to follow and remotely store their own workout progress. Cardio and resistance workouts can be added, along with their relevant statistics (i.e. name, duration, and amounts like weight, distance, reps, sets where applicable). The app allows you to view graphs of your 7 most recent workout sessions.

The main framework of the site (HTML, CSS, front-end JS) is not original and was provided by the Coding Boot Camp. 
## Programs Used
This website was designed with HTML 5, CSS 3.0, and Javascript (2020 Build) in Visual Studio Code 1.55. In addition, the website makes use of several Node.js libraries, and is deployed through Heroku with connections to a MongoDB cloud server.
